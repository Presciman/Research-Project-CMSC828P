## Plan of investigation

Some factors like smoking histroy, age, gender would impact the mutation processes in cancer, like shown in Alexandrov, et al. [1]
Use f-LDA to extract mutation signatures, hope the model could consider the impact of different factors like smoking history
Directly infer the influences of different factors over mutation signatures


Nik-Zainal, et al. [1] analysed whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers. They revealed twelve base-substitution signatures in breast cancer. They also investigated signatures of rearrangement mutational processes, found six rearrangement signatures, and performed unsupervised hierarchical clusterning on the results.

We plan to reproduce several experiments in this article:
1. Base substitution signatures
2. Rearrangement signatures and hierarchical clustering

### Base substitution signatures

#### Experiment


#### Data, resources, and implementation

#### Validation
