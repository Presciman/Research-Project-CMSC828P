# Research Project CMSC828P - Extracting signatures using f-LDA

## Plan of investigation

Some factors like smoking history, age, gender would impact the mutation processes in cancer, as shown in Alexandrov, et al. [1]. We want to use facotrial LDA (f-LDA) to extract mutation signatures, hoping the model could consider the impact of these factors. Paul, et al. [2]. Meanwhile, after training f-LDA, we can directly infer the influences of different factors over mutation signatures from the results.

### Base substitution signatures

#### Experiment


#### Data, resources, and implementation
